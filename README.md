# NASA Fuel Calculation

The project aims to develop a software application for NASA that calculates the fuel required for space flights within the solar system. The application will assist in planning missions by determining the necessary fuel quantities for launching from one planet and landing on another, considering various flight routes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following programs installed:

- Ruby
- Bundler (if you plan to use Bundler for dependency management)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VovaPrymachuk/fuel_calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
cd fuel_calculator
```

3. Install dependencies:

```sh
bundle
```

4. Running the Tests

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

Tests contain 3 cases of space missions: Apollo 11, Mission to Mars, and Passenger.
